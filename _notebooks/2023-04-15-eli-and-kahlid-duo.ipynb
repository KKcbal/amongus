    "# Predictive analysis \n",
    "Predictive analysis is a branch of data analysis that aims to use historical data and statistical algorithms to make predictions about future events. It can be used in various industries, including finance, marketing, healthcare, and more, to make informed decisions based on the likelihood of certain outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real world scenario for predictive analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are a marketing manager for a clothing company, and you want to predict which products will be popular in the upcoming season. You can use predictive analysis to analyze past sales data and customer behavior to make predictions about which products are likely to be successful in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with predictive analysis, you will need to follow these basic steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the problem: In this case, the problem is predicting which products will be popular in the upcoming season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather data: You will need to collect data on past sales, customer behavior, and other relevant factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare the data: You will need to clean and transform the data to make it usable for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a model: There are many different predictive models to choose from, such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. You will need to choose the one that is best suited for your specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the model: You will need to use the historical data to train the model and adjust its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the model: You will need to test the model using a separate set of data to see how accurate it is at making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the model: Once you are satisfied with the model's accuracy, you can use it to make predictions about which products will be popular in the upcoming season.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, predictive analysis can be a powerful tool for making informed decisions in various industries, including marketing. By analyzing past data and making predictions about future events, you can gain a competitive edge and make more informed decisions."
