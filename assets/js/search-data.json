The process of data analysis involves many steps . Data collection: Gathering relevant data from various sources. Data cleaning: Removing inconsistencies, errors, or missing values from the data. Data transformation: Converting data into a format that is more suitable for analysis. Data modeling: Using statistical or machine learning techniques to analyze the data. Data visualization: Presenting the results of the analysis in a clear and concise manner using graphs, charts, or other visual aids. . Notes - Predicitive Analysis . Predictive analysis is the process of using data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. It is a branch of advanced analytics Predictive analysis involves extracting information from data sets and using it to predict patterns and future trends. It involves analyzing large amounts of data and identifying patterns and relationships that can be used to forecast future outcomes. . Examples . Retail. At present, retailers are probably the leading users of predictive - analytics applications Healthcare Internet of Things Sports Weather Insurance Financial Modeling Social Media Analysis .",

            "content": "What is Pandas? . Pandas is an open source Python package which is used for data analysis and machine learning. Pandas is built using numpy which supports it using multidimensional arrays such as what is shown below: . import numpy as np a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) print(a) b = np.reshape( a, # the array to be reshaped (2,3) # dimensions of the new array ) print(b) . [1 2 3 4 5 6] [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] . Data can then be manipulated using pandas to do all sorts of different things such as data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Below is an example of data visualization in a table using pandas. . import pandas as pd pd.__version__ . &#39;1.4.2&#39; . classes = pd.Series([&quot;Mathematics&quot;,&quot;Chemistry&quot;,&quot;Physics&quot;,&quot;History&quot;,&quot;Geography&quot;,&quot;German&quot;]) grades = pd.Series([90,54,77,22,25]) pd.DataFrame({&quot;Classes&quot;: classes, &quot;Grades&quot;: grades}) .

Tensor Flow is a machine learning platform which has tools to validate and transform large datasets and also provides standard datasets for machine learning training. .

The focus for these weeks is to enable students to perform the aspects of constructing and deploying a simple Website. Fastpages got us started on these concepts, but now we will start building a Website from the ground up. Once again, there will be a lot of learning focused tools and getting things working. But, by the end of the Unit, students will be ready to start many of the technical coding aspects of Web Development, having established a Deployed Website.
